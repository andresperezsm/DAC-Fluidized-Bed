-AdsorptionMainScript calls the FluidizationHydrodynamics class to obtain the phase fractions and mass transfer coefficients as a function of z.

-TothCPIsotherm plots the chemisorption and physisorption isotherms over different temperatures and pressures.

-NewBubbleDiameter is used to find issues in the profile of the bubble diameter since it affects phase fraction and mass transfer coefficients. It depends on the superficial velocity and column diameter.
